SPAM SMS Detection

Overview
SPAM SMS detection is a crucial task that helps protect mobile users from unwanted messages. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that detects SPAM SMS messages.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 12,000 rows and 15 columns, including features such as SMS text data and labels.

Methodology
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, tokenizing text data, and removing stop words.
2. Feature engineering: Creating new features that capture relevant information.
3. Model selection: Comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters using cross-validation and grid search.

Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 96.2% and a precision score of 95.5%. The most important features contributing to the prediction were keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and text features.
